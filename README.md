** DNS **

** GSLB **

** MAC Address ( media access controls - 48 bits , 1st 24 bits of vendor code)  is a physical address. Is coded by manufacturer and is a burn in address **

** IPV4 - logical address -  addressed to be assigned to the device , 32 bits in length , 8 bit groups  ( called the octet ). We have run out **

** NAT( Network address translation )** -- we have run out of IPV4 **

** IPV6 ** -- made of 128 bits ** -- written using hexadecimal , group of 4 called quartet , has 8 of quartets in all 

** NIC ( network interface card ) - 2 types - internal and external **

** Ethernet switch & flooding ** //TODO more 

** router & ip routing table  ** routing protocol (ospf) ** Connects two n/w of  switches
    ** internet routing table is about 800K routes ***
    ** route with longest bits in the subnet mask **
    ** switches makes forwarding decisions based on  mac addresses **
    ** Routers makes forwarding decisions based on ip addresses **
    ** Wireless access points or APs {access points}  & roaming **


** twisted pair cabling ** twisted to avoid electro magnetic interference
    ** unshielded twisted pair **
    ** shielded twisted pair **
    ** Plenum cable and RJ45 connectors ** T568B coding , which pin goes where ??
